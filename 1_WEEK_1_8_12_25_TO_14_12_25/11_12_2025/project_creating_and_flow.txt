    Basic metadata (size, number of features, etc.)

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    4.1 Import Required Libraries
        import pandas as pd
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns

    4.2 Load Dataset

        Load data from CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.

    4.3 Initial Data Inspection

        head(), tail(), info(), describe()

        Check data types

        Check dataset shape

    4.4 Data Cleaning

        Remove duplicates

        Handle missing values

        Fix wrong data types


    4.5 Data Visualization

        Use:

        Matplotlib

        Seaborn
            Examples:

            Distribution plots

            Boxplots

            Heatmaps

            Scatter plots

            Pairplots

    4.6 Insights from EDA

        Summarize patterns found

        Highlight important correlations

        Identify anomalies and trends


5. Data Preprocessing
    5.1 Encoding

        Convert categorical/string columns to numeric

        One-Hot Encoding

        Label Encoding

    5.2 Feature Engineering

        Create new features

        Select important features

    5.3 Train–Test Split

        Split the dataset into training and testing sets

        from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    5.4 Feature Scaling

        Apply scaling after splitting (to avoid data leakage)

        StandardScaler

        MinMaxScaler
