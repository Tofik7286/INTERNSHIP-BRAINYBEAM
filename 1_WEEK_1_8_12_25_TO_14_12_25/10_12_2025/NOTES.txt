	-> title : Data science introduction 



Notes:

1. What is data science?
-> data science is about data gathering , analysing and decision-making.
-> Data science is about finding patterns in data, through proper analysis & by making future Predictions for data.
-> By using Data Science companies are able to make :- 
	1. Better decisions (should we choose A or B)
	2. Predictive analysis (What will happen next)
	3. Pattern discoveries (Make pattern or finding hidden information)

2. Importance of Data Science.
-> Data science is a deep study of the massive amount of data, which involves extracting meaningful insights from raw, structured, and     
   unstructured data that is processed using the scientific method, different technologies, and algorithms.
-> As organizations are generating and storing more and more data, they are looking to hire professionals who can dig into this 
   overwhelming amount of Data to derive valuable insights that can help drive business decisions. Data Scientist are one of the highest   
   paid professionals across the industries . As per LinkedIn job reports, the Data Science industry is expected to grow from 37.9 billion
   USD in 2019 to 230 billion USD by 2026.

3. Roadmap of data science.
-> 
	1. Prerequisites:
		Educational Background: Most data scientists have at least a bachelor's degree in a quantitative field such as computer science,
		statistics, mathematics, physics, engineering, or a related field. Some have advanced degrees (master's or Ph.D.) as well.

		Programming Skills: Develop proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R, which are commonly used in data
		science.

	2. Learn the Basics:

		Mathematics and Statistics: Build a strong foundation in linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics. Topics like hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and 		Bayesian statistics are particularly important.

		Data Manipulation: Learn how to work with data using libraries like Pandas (Python) or dplyr (R).

	3. Data Visualization:

		Learn data visualization techniques using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn (Python) or ggplot2 (R).
		Visualization is important for exploring and presenting data effectively.

	4. Data Preprocessing:

		Learn how to clean, preprocess, and transform data for analysis. This includes handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

	5. Machine Learning:

		Understand the fundamentals of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, classification, regression, clustering, and more.

		Explore popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn (Python) or caret (R).

	6. Deep Learning (Optional):

		If interested in deep learning, delve into neural networks and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
	
	7. SQL and Databases:

		Gain proficiency in SQL to query and manipulate relational databases, as data scientists often work with large datasets stored in databases.

	8. Big Data Technologies (Optional):

		Familiarize yourself with big data technologies such as Hadoop and Spark, especially if you plan to work with large-scale data.
