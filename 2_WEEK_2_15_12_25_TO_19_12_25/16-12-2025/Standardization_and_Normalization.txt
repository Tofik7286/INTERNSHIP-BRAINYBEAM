Standardization and Normalizations are scaling techniques.

There are two types of methods
    1. StandardScaler

        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        - train data is not always fitted so we have to fit it using ss.fit(x_train)
            - ss is variable name
            - fit is StandardScaler method 
            - x_train is also variable 
            once the data is fit we can easily transform it.
            
    2. MinMaxScaler
