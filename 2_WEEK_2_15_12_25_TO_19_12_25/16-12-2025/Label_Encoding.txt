Label Encoding: Encoding Techniques- Label Encoding & One-hot Encoder


1. Label Encoding
. Label Encoding is a technique used to convert categorical data into numerical data.
. It assigns a unique numerical value to each category present in the categorical variable.
. It is useful for ordinal categorical data, where the categories have a natural ordering, such as small, medium, large.
. Label Encoding can lead to the false assumption of a natural ordering between categories, which can affect the performance of certain machine learning algorithms.
. It is straightforward to implement and can be easily used in a variety of machine learning models.


2. One-Hot Encoding:
· One-Hot Encoding is a technique used to convert categorical data into a
binary representation.
. It creates a new.binary column for each category present in the categorical
variable and assigns a value of 1 to the corresponding column for each
observation.
. One-Hot Encoding avoids the false assumption of a natural ordering between
categories, and it can be easily used in a variety of machine learning models.
. However, One-Hot Encoding can lead to the curse of dimensionality, where
the number of features increases significantly when there are many
categories, which can affect the performance of some machine learning
algorithms.
